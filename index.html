                <p>How often do you see an accident on your way to work? What if you could avoid heavy traffic due to accidents and have a safe route to your destination. Safe Routes, provides an interact map showing all the accidents at every intersection on the way to your destination.</p>

                        <h2>What Safe Routes does for you</h2>
                        <p>Safe Routes has many key features that educate users on driving risk. Users can search for crashes near any address in five SF Bay Area counties, and specify crashes that only include certain features (like accidents that occurred at night or in snow). Additionally, a predictive model kicks in that elucidates how likely those conditions will cause an accident on that road today. If a user only wants the big picture about crashes in the Bay Area, there is a carousel of descriptive graphics that among other things cover the number of crashes by week/hour and the specific types of crashes by roadway.</p>

                        <h2>The Data Behind Safe Routes</h2>
                        <p>The dataset the crash map is populated from are the most recent three years (2015-2017) of the Department of Transportation's Fatality Analysis Reporting System. With this dataset we could identify crashes with exact longitude and latitude precision, and get a variety of classification data such as the type of roadway. As per the name, all datapoints are of fatal accidents, so in order to make a predictive model for accidents the data science team had to generate almost 20,000 rows of additional 'not crash' data referencing the real traffic flow. One place of improvement is to get the true traffic flow data if it exists, and generate complex features, because the project ran out of time for much experimentation.</p>
